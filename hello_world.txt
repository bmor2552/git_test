So here we are making changes to our work again lol
So, I ran into an issue with keys and key chains I was able to find what the issue was 
I had to select repo when creating my personal access token 
I ended up delete the first one I created and then selecting the right options for the new one. 
Making edits to both the read me and the text doc to test out this new access !!
